Project Description:
--------------------
This Project is an attempt to build a system that is able to monitor and control the greenhouse according to the set points set by the user on temperature and soil moisture. Also, it is able to monitor and control internal artificial light, for instance light bulbs, tube-lights, etc. and adjusts according to the natural light coming in. If the natural light coming in is enough for the plantation inside the greenhouse, then the lights should be off and if not then they should turn on automatically.
